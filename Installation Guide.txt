Setup:

    #1 Python extensions:

	1) pymysql
	2) piazza_api

	//use "pip install #######" in cmd

    #2 MySQL:
	
	1. create connection on localhost if not already made
	2. open the file Modules/trybot_db2.mwb
	3. forward engineer the table to the connection on localhost

    #3 trybot:
	1. open the file Modules/Main.py
	2. change the variables in the comment section "Modify below"
	
    #4 OPTIONAL:
    	Modules/Mint2.py, variable "threshold" is used to decide how much the keywords
    	have to match before it assumes to have found an answer and post this answer


After setup start the program by running Modules/Main.py

// If used on an existing piazza class:
// The bot might answer some already existing posts in the first run, if you dont want this
// open the file Modules/Fint.py and comment out code line 95
// ie. "self._network.create_followup(self._network.get_post(cid), content, False)"
// and run the program so that it can update the database first, after it is up to date, remove
// the commented code line and start the program again
